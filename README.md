# Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict car prices using various machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about car features and their selling prices.

## Objectives

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Selection and Engineering
3. Model Training and Evaluation
4. Model Comparison and Selection

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Categorical encoding
   - Feature scaling

2. **Feature Selection and Engineering**

3. **Algorithms**:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting

4. **Model Training, Evaluation & Selection**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets
   - Train the models
   - Evaluate the models using MSE and RÂ² metrics

## Results

The Random Forest model performed the best among the three models evaluated.

## Usage

To run the notebook, clone the repository and open the `CarPricePrediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
